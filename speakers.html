      <p>Geoffrey Grosenbach has been designing and developing web applications since 1997. You might recognize his soothing voice from the Peepcode screencasts, of which he is the founder. Or maybe you also know he is nuts about road cycling, a hobby and so much more!</p>
      <p>Residing in Seattle, WA, the birthplace of grunge music, maybe try sharing your favorite coffee tip, or even mention the 'amazing' Starbucks ;)</p>

      <p>Brian is probably best known for his role on the <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a> team, where he has worked full-time for the past four years thanks to <a href="http://engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a>. He has also created the RubySpec project to improve the standards for high quality, consistent, and compliant Ruby implementations, and is focused on improving Ruby and thereby making the lives of developers even better.</p>

      <footer><a href="http://blog.headius.com/">Website</a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/headius">Twitter</a> - <a href="https://github.com/headius/">Github</a></footer>
      <p>Charles has been programming most of his life, as a Java developer for the past decade and as a JRuby developer for over six years. He co-leads the <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a> project, an effort to bring the beauty of Ruby and the power of the JVM together. Charles believes in open source and open standards and hopes his efforts on JRuby and other languages will ensure the JVM remains the preferred open-source managed runtime for many years to come.</p>
      <p>Did you know Charles has an awesome beard? Maybe you might both bond over beard grooming advice!</p>

      <p>Rick is a developer at GitHub, a self-diagnosed REST nerd, bleeding edge DB enthusiast, with an active OSS profile. Rick calls himself a gif artist and a crappy Looptastic DJ who enjoys reading comic books. But really, if you know Rick, he loves his Dubstep :)</p>

      <p>Roy has been a front-end specialist for almost a decade. As one of the co-founders of consultancy 80beans here in Amsterdam, he weaves HTML5 and CSS3 magic on an hourly basis. As well as being in love with front-end meta languages like haml, sass and coffeescript, he is all about a sweet mixture of function and form.</p>
      <p>Fun Fact: We hear Roy loves a good vodka or 10 ;)</p>

      <p>Living in the land of muscles, and Jean Claude Van Damme, Elise has been a software developer in Belgium for more than 10 years. She has used a variety of languages on a variety of environments, and has spoken at a variety of conferences all over the world.</p>

      <p>Having spent the last couple of years building systems at Heroku, Ryan was previously studying Mathematics at Missouri Kansas City University.</p>
      <p>He is not your typical ruby developer, he is a special breed of pragmatic polyglot developer who also heavily believes in the UNIX way, so much so it is almost like a religion to him!</p>
      <p>Ryan has some awesome hair, why not share a hair grooming tip or two? Or even better, get your hair styled like his!</p>

      <p>Sean is a pianist, software engineer, composer, philosopher, web designer, conductor, singer, teacher, and technology advocate. So I guess the question really is, 'what isn't Sean Cribbs?'</p>
      <p>As a Software Engineer for Basho Technologies, Sean spends his time hacking in Ruby, Erlang, and JavaScript (and occasionally Python) on the client interfaces to Riak, Basho's distributed, fault-tolerant database.</p>
      <p>Random fact : Sean used to be a Choir director for 3 years, and we hear from a reputable source that he loves it when you sing Silent Night to him in falsetto!</p>

      <p>Steve maintains the Hackety Hack project, which allows anyone to learn software development via Ruby. He was a Ruby Hero in 2011 and is involved with many Ruby-based open source projects. Steve also teaches the best Ruby and Rails classes on Earth with Jumpstart Lab.</p>
      <p>True story : Many kids have asked for Steves autograph thinking that he is Skrillex!</p>
      <p>Instead of EuRuKo trying for the largest Friday Hug, this year we will be aiming for the largest number of audience member with a Skrillex haircut!</p>

      <p>Eloy, who was born and raised in this year’s host city ‘beautiful Amsterdam’, has long been working at the intersection of open-source Ruby and Objective-C/Cocoa. This combination has lead to his current job at <a href="http://www.fngtps.com/">Fingertips</a> where he works on Web, iPhone, iPad and Mac OS X apps.</p>
      <p>His open-source time is spent on <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>, <a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a>, and many related projects.</p>
      <p>If, at some point, you might think "who’s making that music?", then it might be Eloy, who’s constantly beatboxing unconsciously. If you are up for it we can organize a beatbox showdown on stage!</p>

      <p>Vicent Martí has a name which is difficult to pronounce. Despite his main occupation as bananologist, he spends his spare time working full time at GitHub, where he builds tools for the people who build the Internet.</p>
      <p>His dreams invaded by shadowy figures: pink ponies and raw pointers, he loves sharing his love for what he believes is beautiful technology. An European citizen (Spain, according to his passport), Vicent enjoys drums and yellow things and the sweet sweet smell of civilization.</p>
      <p>We are slightly worried about his love for bananas, he even requested he have some available 'backstage', we didn't even know we had a 'backstage'!</p>

      <p>Did someone say German engineering? Let me tell you about German engineering: It is boring! It is thorough, it is efficient, and it just works.</p>
      <p>Martin has been doing this stuff for more than 20 years now. He tamed the very first home computers, made assembly code fit into HBLANK, and ran a BSD-based home server before Linux had even surfaced. Currently he is developing highly scalable backends for the Berlin-based social gaming company Wooga.</p>
      <p>Want to show him you know your stuff? Bring along a ZX Spectrum with Wolfenstein 3D ported to it!</p>

      <p>When we think 'Mitchell Hashimoto' the first thing that comes to mind for us is <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, the awesome tool for creating and distributing virtualized development environments. In short, it makes <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> awesome to use!</p>
      <p>Mitchell spends his days as an operations engineer for a start-up company in San Francisco. He is Passionate (with a capital P) about all things open source, and boy does he show this passion with awesome contributions to the community.</p>
      <p>We often hear crazy reasons why people got into programming, welllllll, did you know that Mitchell only wanted to learn how to code so he could cheat neopets!!! Without neopets, he may have never found computers!!!</p>
      <p>Do you have a neopet? Maybe bring one to EuRuKo and get some special 'hints' from Mitchell ;)</p>
