![EuRuKo Golf](/images/blog/euruko-golf.png)

Only a few weeks until EuRuKo, we are all very excited. In the meantime, to get you in a festive Ruby hacking mood, we have something very special for you: 

Our awesome friends and supporters over at [wooga](http://www.wooga.com) launched a Ruby golf contest. You can win one of four tickets to the conference, including accommodation. How awesome is that?

So head over to their [site](http://www.wooga.com/2012/05/euruko/) to learn more about the contest. Happy golfing everyone!
