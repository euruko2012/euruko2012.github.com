Picking speakers for a conference is a hard job, you have so many things to take into account, like the theme, how many spots, experienced speaker vs first timer, local vs oversees, and the dreaded limited number of spots. Also, since we were using Pull Requests, the process was open, which meant we had lots of comments to take into account. (eg. do we take a talk which has lots of +1s or one with a few really good comments?)

Many times during the selection process we were left thinking 'this sucks, we need to add more speakers!' In fact, we said that enough times that we did just that, we created a mixture of 20min and 30min talk slots (each with 10 minutes for questions, and 5 minutes for changeover) just so we could add two more spots, and we think that it was worth it!

We are sorry we couldn't accept more talks, because frankly we would have loved to accept all of them! If you would like further feedback please contact [Josh](mailto:josh@euruko2012.org) and he will do his best to help.

So without a further ado, here are the final speakers for EuRuKo 2012!


## Ryan Smith - Heroku
[Website](http://ryandotsmith.heroku.com/) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ryandotsmith) - [Github](https://github.com/ryandotsmith)

Having spent the last couple of years building systems at Heroku, Ryan was previously studying Mathematics at Missouri Kansas City University.

He is not your typical ruby developer, he is a special breed of pragmatic polyglot developer who also heavily believes in the UNIX way, so much so it is almost like a religion to him!

Ryan has some awesome hair, why not share a hair grooming tip or two? Or even better, get your hair styled like his!


## Sean Cribbs - Basho
[Website](http://seancribbs.com/) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seancribbs) - [Github](https://github.com/seancribbs)

Sean is a pianist, software engineer, composer, philosopher, web designer, conductor, singer, teacher, and technology advocate. So I guess the question really is, 'what isn't Sean Cribbs?'

As a Software Engineer for Basho Technologies, Sean spends his time hacking in Ruby, Erlang, and JavaScript (and occasionally Python) on the client interfaces to Riak, Basho's distributed, fault-tolerant database.

Random fact : Sean used to be a Choir director for 3 years, and we hear from a reputable source that he loves it when you sing Silent Night to him in falsetto!


## Steve Klabnik - Hackety Hack
[Website](http://steveklabnik.com/) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik) - [Github](https://github.com/steveklabnik)

A teacher, aspiring digital humanities scholar and open source developer, Steve is just an all round great guy!

Steve maintains the Hackety Hack project, which allows anyone to learn software development via Ruby. He was a Ruby Hero in 2011 and is involved with many Ruby-based open source projects. Steve also teaches the best Ruby and Rails classes on Earth with Jumpstart Lab.

True story : Many kids have asked for Steves autograph thinking that he is Skrillex!

Instead of EuRuKo trying for the largest Friday Hug, this year we will be aiming for the largest number of audience member with a Skrillex haircut!


## Eloy Durán - Fngtps
[Website](http://soup.superalloy.nl) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alloy) - [Github](https://github.com/alloy)

Eloy, who was born and raised in this year’s host city ‘beautiful Amsterdam’, has long been working at the intersection of open-source Ruby and Objective-C/Cocoa. This combination has lead to his current job at [Fingertips](http://www.fngtps.com/) where he works on Web, iPhone, iPad and Mac OS X apps.

His open-source time is spent on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/), [MacRuby](http://www.macruby.org/), and many related projects.

If, at some point, you might think "who’s making that music?", then it might be Eloy, who’s constantly beatboxing unconsciously. If you are up for it we can organize a beatbox showdown on stage!


## Vicent Marti - GitHub
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/tanoku) - [Github](https://github.com/tanoku)

Vicent Martí has a name which is difficult to pronounce. Despite his main occupation as bananologist, he spends his spare time working full time at GitHub, where he builds tools for the people who build the Internet.

His dreams invaded by shadowy figures: pink ponies and raw pointers, he loves sharing his love for what he believes is beautiful technology. An European citizen (Spain, according to his passport), Vicent enjoys drums and yellow things and the sweet sweet smell of civilization.

We are slightly worried about his love for bananas, he even requested he have some available 'backstage', we didn't even know we had a 'backstage'!


## Martin Rehfeld - Wooga
[Website](http://inside.glnetworks.de) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/klickmich) - [Github](https://github.com/martinrehfeld)

Did someone say German engineering? Let me tell you about German engineering: It is boring! It is thorough, it is efficient, and it just works.

Martin has been doing this stuff for more than 20 years now. He tamed the very first home computers, made assembly code fit into HBLANK, and ran a BSD-based home server before Linux had even surfaced. Currently he is developing highly scalable backends for the Berlin-based social gaming company Wooga.

Want to show him you know your stuff? Bring along a ZX Spectrum with Wolfenstein 3D ported to it!


_And the final big welcome too......_

## Mitchell Hashimoto - Klip
[Website](http://mitchellhashimoto.com) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mitchellh) - [Github](https://github.com/mitchellh)

When we think 'Mitchell Hashimoto' the first thing that comes to mind for us is [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/), the awesome tool for creating and distributing virtualized development environments. In short, it makes [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) awesome to use!

Mitchell spends his days as an operations engineer for a start-up company in San Francisco. He is Passionate (with a capital P) about all things open source, and boy does he show this passion with awesome contributions to the community.

We often hear crazy reasons why people got into programming, welllllll, did you know that Mitchell only wanted to learn how to code so he could cheat neopets!!! Without neopets, he may have never found computers!!!

Do you have a neopet? Maybe bring one to EuRuKo and get some special 'hints' from Mitchell ;)


-----------------------

So there we have it, all 13 speakers, including two amazing keynote speakers.

We are sorry for the delay in announcing this, and sorry that we couldn't pick more, but join us in welcoming these amazing speakers to EuRuKo for 2012.

Huge <3 from the Nederlands!

The EuRuKo Team
