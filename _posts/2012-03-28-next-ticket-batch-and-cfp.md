It's been a while since our last update, but a lot of work is being done behind the curtains.

We've arranged enough parties to have everyone busy during their stay in this vibrant, magical city, ensuring that you'll never get bored, although we highly doubt that would ever happen :)

### Tickets sale
Several people have reported some discrepancies about the announcement of tonight's ticket sale and the <abbr title="Call For Proposals">CFP</abbr> closing.

We used [CET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time) for the announcement but [CEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Summer_Time) should have been used instead. Therefore, to clear out any confusion, all times from now on will be announced using the CEST offset, so the tickets sale is tonight at **8:00 PM CEST**. We are sorry if this is confusing our friends outside of Europe but please bear with us, [DST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) is supposed to save us millions of € a year, or so they say...

### Call for proposals
We are amazed by the amount of positive feedback we've received regarding the system we use for proposals and the amount of amazing proposals we've received is making the decision taking more complicated, so keep it up!

So far we've received **more than [85 proposals on GitHub!](https://github.com/euruko2012/call-for-proposals/pulls)**

### Deadline
The <abbr title="Call For Proposals">CFP</abbr> will close this Friday, 30th of March at midnight (CEST). Make sure to submit your pull request on time!

### Boat party time
The starting time for the boat party on the 31st hasn't been set yet but it'll most likely be around 7:00PM/8:00PM (CEST) – We'll give you more details as soon as we possibly can!

### Thanks
Finally we want to thank all the people and companies that are making this possible, you guys are the best! We've sold more than half of the [supporter tickets](http://www.amiando.com/euruko2012.html) so far, so once again: Thank You!
