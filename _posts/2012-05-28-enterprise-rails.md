Our remaining Gold sponsor is [EnterpriseRails](http://www.enterprise-rails.com/), a top-notch hosting provider for Rails apps. They can also help you out with all stages of planning and developing Rails projects.

EnterpriseRails aims to allow you to focus entirely on your product and leave the rest up to them. Reliability, scalability, monitoring, backups and a comprehensive server management program including installation, automation and software updates on German-based servers. Their SLAs are rigorously upheld with a frantic passion to make your solutions sail smoothly.

Reduce the workload on your team and work with experienced Rails hosting supporters. Together you will work through security audits and secure your solutions' operability.

Check out a short selection of their [customers](http://www.enterprise-rails.com/references) and their track record of presences at [conferences](http://www.enterprise-rails.com/photos/index).
